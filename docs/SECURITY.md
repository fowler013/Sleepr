# Security Guidelines

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Sleepr application and best practices for maintaining security.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Environment Variables
- **JWT_SECRET**: Required environment variable for secure authentication
- **Database URL**: Uses environment variables to avoid hardcoded credentials
- No sensitive data stored in version control

### 2. Input Validation
- **ID Validation**: All ID parameters validated as positive integers
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Input sanitization middleware blocks common injection patterns
- **Parameter Sanitization**: Query parameters checked for dangerous SQL keywords

### 3. CORS Configuration
- **Restricted Origins**: Only allows specific localhost origins in development
- **Production Ready**: Easy to configure for production domains
- **Credentials Handling**: Properly configured CORS credentials

### 4. Database Security
- **Parameterized Queries**: All database queries use parameterized statements
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Proper referential integrity maintained
- **Cascade Deletes**: Controlled data deletion with CASCADE constraints

### 5. API Security
- **Request Logging**: All API requests logged for monitoring
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages that don't leak system information
- **Health Checks**: Non-sensitive endpoint for monitoring

## Security Best Practices

### Environment Setup
1. **Always use strong JWT secrets in production**:
   ```bash
   # Generate a secure JWT secret
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```

2. **Database Security**:
   - Use SSL/TLS for database connections in production
   - Implement database user with minimal required privileges
   - Regular database backups with encryption

3. **API Security**:
   - Implement rate limiting for production
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Monitor and log all API access

### Development Security
1. **Never commit sensitive data**:
   - .env files are in .gitignore
   - Use environment variables for all secrets
   - Rotate secrets regularly

2. **Input Validation**:
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Sanitize data before database operations
   - Use parameterized queries only

3. **Authentication & Authorization**:
   - Implement JWT-based authentication
   - Add role-based access control for sensitive operations
   - Session management with secure cookies

## Security Checklist

### Before Production Deployment
- [ ] Generate strong JWT secret
- [ ] Configure CORS for production domains
- [ ] Enable SSL/TLS for database connections
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Review and audit all API endpoints
- [ ] Implement proper logging
- [ ] Configure secure headers
- [ ] Set up backup and recovery procedures

### Regular Security Maintenance
- [ ] Update dependencies regularly
- [ ] Monitor security advisories
- [ ] Rotate secrets periodically
- [ ] Review access logs
- [ ] Conduct security audits
- [ ] Test backup and recovery procedures

## Vulnerability Reporting
If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:
1. Do not create public issues for security vulnerabilities
2. Contact the development team directly
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow time for the issue to be addressed before disclosure

## Security Updates
- Dependencies are regularly updated to address security vulnerabilities
- Security patches are prioritized and deployed quickly
- All security updates are documented in the changelog

## Compliance
The application follows security best practices including:
- OWASP Top 10 security guidelines
- Secure coding practices
- Data protection principles
- Input validation and output encoding

For questions about security, please contact the development team.
